# check-website - Currently not running
GitHub Action to check a website for changes. Currently uses [w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) to render the website before saving it to a plain text file. Emails on change.
Update to use [colordiff](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/colordiff) and the previous cache at some point. Might bne nice to have an RSS feed.
